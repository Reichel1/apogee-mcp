# Apogee MCP - Cursor Directory Submission

## Server Information

**Name:** Apogee MCP  
**One-liner:** The MCP server that lets multiple dev agents collaborate safely‚Äîshared TODOs, conflict-free patches, and Claude-owned DB migrations.  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Author:** Apogee Studios  
**License:** MIT  
**Homepage:** https://mcp.apogeestudios.dev  
**Repository:** https://github.com/apogee-studios/ai-dev-sdk  

## Installation

### NPM Installation
```bash
npm install -g @apogee/mcp-server
```

### Cursor Configuration (.cursor/mcp.json)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apogee": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@apogee/mcp-server", "--stdio"],
      "env": {
        "APOGEE_ROLE": "implementer",
        "APOGEE_SESSION_ID": "cursor-session"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Elevator Pitch

Apogee MCP is a standards-compliant Model Context Protocol server that plugs into Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenAI Agents. Teams get coordinated, simultaneous multi-agent development with role-based guardrails (e.g., Claude runs Supabase migrations; GPT implements app code) and an observable communications feed.

## Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)

### üè¢ Agencies & Product Squads
**Who:** Development teams using Cursor/Claude Code for client work  
**Pain:** Multiple AI tools stepping on each other during rapid development cycles  
**Solution:** Coordinated multi-model workflows with clear role separation  

### üöÄ Supabase Startups  
**Who:** Startups building on Supabase who need automated, safe migrations  
**Pain:** Fear of breaking production with manual schema changes  
**Solution:** Claude-owned migrations with policy enforcement and drift detection  

### üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise Platform Teams
**Who:** Large teams piloting agentic development flows  
**Pain:** Need governance, audit trails, and SSO for AI development tools  
**Solution:** Enterprise-grade MCP with policy enforcement and compliance features  

## Core Features & Tools

### üõ†Ô∏è MCP Tools
- **apogee.todo.update** - Shared task management between AI agents
- **apogee.fence.set** - Write fence coordination to prevent conflicts  
- **apogee.patch.apply** - Safe code patch application with CI integration
- **apogee.db.migrate** - Database migrations (Claude/planner role only)
- **apogee.comms.post** - Structured inter-agent communication

### üìä MCP Resources
- **log://comms** - Live communication feed between agents
- **todos://board** - Current task assignments and status
- **schema://current** - Live database schema (Supabase integration)
- **ci://latest** - Build and test status

### üîë Key Benefits
1. **Conflict Prevention** - Write fence system prevents simultaneous file modifications
2. **Role Separation** - Clear boundaries between planner (Claude) and implementer (Cursor) roles  
3. **Real-time Sync** - Live updates via MCP resources for coordinated development
4. **Database Safety** - Enforced separation of schema management from application code
5. **Observable Collaboration** - Complete audit trail of agent interactions

## Workflow Example

### 1. Planning Phase (Claude Code as Planner)
```javascript
// Claude designs database and creates tasks
await apogee.todo.update({
  diff: [{
    operation: "create",
    desc: "Create user authentication API endpoints",
    assignee: "implementer", 
    status: "pending"
  }]
});

// Claude runs database migration
await apogee.db.migrate({
  planId: "create_users_table"
});
// Result: ‚úÖ Users table created with RLS policies
```

### 2. Implementation Phase (Cursor as Implementer)
```javascript
// Cursor checks shared state
const schema = await mcp.readResource('schema://current');
const todos = await mcp.readResource('todos://board');

// Cursor implements API based on schema
await apogee.patch.apply({
  diff: `--- a/src/auth.ts
+++ b/src/auth.ts
@@ -0,0 +1,25 @@
+export async function createUser(userData) {
+  return supabase.from('users').insert(userData);
+}`,
  rationale: "Implement user creation endpoint using migrated schema"
});
// Result: ‚úÖ Patch applied successfully, tests passing
```

### 3. Coordination & Handoffs
```javascript
// Explicit handoff protocol
await apogee.fence.set({ owner: "implementer" });
await apogee.comms.post({
  text: "Database ready. HANDOFF::implementer - build the auth endpoints",
  tags: ["handoff", "auth", "ready"]
});
```
